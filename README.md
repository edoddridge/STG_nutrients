This repository contains the source code for an axis-symmetric nutrient model for subtropical gyres. The underlying functions of the model are contained in `STG_nutrient_budget_funcs.py`, ad the model solutions are calculated in the notebook `diffusion_model - sensitivity testing for repo.ipynb`. The analysis of the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) is shown in the notebook `Analyse BATS data.ipynb`.

The code depends on a number of modules including
- numpy
- numba
- scipy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- xarray
